# üìù GitHub Issues Summary

**Created:** October 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Development issues following architecture evaluation approval

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Created

Following @rodrigozago's approval of the current architecture, I've prepared:

1. **DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md** - Comprehensive development roadmap
2. **create_issues.sh** - Script to create 18 GitHub issues
3. This summary document

---

## üöÄ How to Create the Issues

### Option 1: Run the Script (Recommended)

The script will create all 18 issues automatically:

```bash
# Make sure you're authenticated with GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Run the script
./create_issues.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Creation

If you prefer to create issues manually, see the [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) for detailed descriptions of each issue.

**Breakdown:**
- Phase 1 (Core API): 4-6 weeks
- Phase 2 (BFF + Frontend): 7-10 weeks  
- Phase 3 (Production): 2-3 weeks

**Critical Path:**
1. Core API Internal Auth (Week 1)
2. Core API Endpoints (Week 2-3)
3. BFF Auth Integration (Week 4-5)
4. BFF Core Integration (Week 6-7)
5. Frontend Dashboard (Week 8-10)
6. Testing & Hardening (Week 11-13)
7. Production Deployment (Week 14-15)

---

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### Start with Phase 1 (Core API First)

As requested by @rodrigozago, prioritize the Core API issues:

1. **Week 1-2:** Internal Authentication + Complete Endpoints
2. **Week 3:** Performance Optimizations
3. **Week 4:** Database Optimization
4. **Week 5-6:** Testing + Documentation

Then move to Phase 2 (Client App).

## üè∑Ô∏è Labels to Create

If these labels don't exist in your repo, create them first:

### Priority Labels
- `priority:critical` (red) - Must be done for MVP
- `priority:high` (orange) - Important for good UX
- `priority:medium` (yellow) - Nice to have

### Area Labels
- `area:core-api` (blue)
- `area:bff` (blue)
- `area:frontend` (blue)
- `area:database` (purple)
- `area:testing` (green)
- `area:deployment` (gray)
- `area:documentation` (gray)
- `area:security` (red)

### Type Labels
- `type:feature` (green)
- `type:enhancement` (blue)
- `type:bug` (red)
- `type:documentation` (gray)

### Phase Labels
- `phase:1` (milestone)
- `phase:2` (milestone)
- `phase:3` (milestone)

## üìã Issue Creation Commands

If you prefer to create issues one by one with `gh` CLI:

```bash
# Example for first issue
gh issue create \
  --repo rodrigozago/sietch-faces \
  --title "[Core API] Implement Internal Authentication System" \
  --body "$(cat issue_descriptions/core-auth.md)" \
  --label "priority:critical,area:core-api,type:feature,phase:1"
```

The `create_issues.sh` script contains all 18 issues ready to create.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Review the roadmap** - See [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)
2. **Create labels** - Set up the label system in GitHub
3. **Create issues** - Run `./create_issues.sh` or create manually
4. **Assign to developers** - Distribute work across team
5. **Start with Phase 1** - Begin Core API development
6. **Track progress** - Use GitHub Projects or milestones
