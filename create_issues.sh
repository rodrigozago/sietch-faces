# Issue 1.1: Internal Authentication System
create_issue \
"[Core API] Implement Internal Authentication System" \
"## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Implement API key-based authentication for secure BFF â†’ Core API communication.

## ðŸ“‹ Context
As per the architecture evaluation (ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION.md), the Core API currently has no authentication. This needs to be added to secure communication between the Next.js BFF and the FastAPI Core.

## âœ… Tasks

- [ ] Add API key authentication middleware to FastAPI
- [ ] Create API key management system (generate, validate, rotate)
- [ ] Add environment variable \`CORE_API_KEY\` for configuration
- [ ] Secure all Core API endpoints with authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting per API key
- [ ] Document authentication flow in API_EXAMPLES.md
- [ ] Update Postman collection with authentication

## ðŸ“Š Acceptance Criteria

- Core API requires valid API key for all requests
- BFF can authenticate successfully with Core
- Unauthorized requests return 401 Unauthorized
- API keys can be rotated without service downtime
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (e.g., 1000 req/min per key)
- Documentation updated with authentication examples

## ðŸ”— Related

- See: ARCHITECTURE.md - Security Model section
- See: ARCHITECTURE_EVALUATION.md - Priority 1 improvements
- Milestone: Core API Completion

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Notes

Consider using FastAPI's dependency injection with \`Security\` dependency:
\`\`\`python
from fastapi import Security, HTTPException
from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader

api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name=\"X-API-Key\")

def validate_api_key(api_key: str = Security(api_key_header)):
    if api_key != settings.CORE_API_KEY:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401)
    return api_key

"[Security] Production Security Hardening" \
"## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Implement security best practices for production deployment.

## ðŸ“‹ Context
Production deployment requires additional security measures beyond basic authentication.

## âœ… Tasks
